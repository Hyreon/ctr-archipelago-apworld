"""A real stage 2 gate is never already met by its own pad's stage 1 (issue #342).

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
The sphere search draws a pad's stage 1 and stage 2 independently, then lowers
each independently in `_post_process`, and stage 2 has the lower count ceiling
(4 against 8). Before #342 that regularly produced rows like "8 trophies, then
4 trophies": the stage 2 gate is met the moment the pad opens, so it never
blocks anything. Over 120 default seeds that was 1.5 such gates per seed, about
four times Icebound's rate (0.4 per seed over 300 standalone seeds).

The rule now: same item type is allowed only if stage 2 is strictly higher;
otherwise stage 2 is redrawn from another item family. A stage 2 may still be an
EXACT copy of stage 1, which is the intended collapse ("no gate beyond the
trophy race").

The invariant is asserted on the wire rows native parses
(`fill_slot_data()["warp_pad_unlock"]`), physical-pad keyed, so it covers the
real host pad under destination shuffle.
